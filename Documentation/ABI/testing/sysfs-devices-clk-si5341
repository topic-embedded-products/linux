Description:	Allows programming the NVM memory of the clock chip, so it boots
		up in the current configuration. This saves boot time (300ms
		clock initialization) and allows the clock to be available
		before the kernel boots (e.g. u-boot ethernet clock).

		Write the magic value 0xc7 to this attribute to program the
		chip's current settings into its NVM storage. This magic value
		is taken from the datasheet, it's the same value that must be
		written to the hardware to program it. Programming can only be
		done twice in the lifetime of the chip.

		Read the value to check the state of the chip. This returns the
		raw value as read from the hardware. Possible values:
		0x03: Not programmed
		0x0f: Programmed once
		0x3f: Programmed twice, can no longer be programmed

Users:		User space applications for embedded boards equipped with one
		or more Si534x programmable clock devices. Would typically be
		used at the end of production stages.
